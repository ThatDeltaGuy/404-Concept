  <blockquote><strong>Once</strong> upon some free time clearly, while I net surfed weak and weary,<br/>
Going through my favorite websites and the pages I adore.<br/>
As I typed out every address, surfing past the mottled net mess,<br/>
There came a blank page on my screen which I had never seen before.<br/>
On my screen there was a web page with words I’d never seen before.<br/>
<em>It had three numbers, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Ah, distinctly I remember, waiting for the page to render<br/>
And each separate graphics splendour to appear upon the screen once more.<br/>
Eagerly I awaited the download of the full HTML code<br/>
And have my browser be bestowed another page which would not bore.<br/>
Waiting for my favourite pages filled with content which would not bore.<br/>
<em>Yet all it said was, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Each successive futile refresh strained my patience to its full test,<br/>
Causing me to utter swear words I have hardly ever used before.<br/>
So that I had started yelling, because of anger which was welling,<br/>
Tis some error with my system keeping me from surfing more.<br/>
Some DNS or IP error keeping me from surfing more.<br/>
<em>And on the page was, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Presently my angst grew stronger; errors on the page grew longer,<br/>
“Webmaster” said I, “or System Admin a resolution I implore”.<br/>
But the fact is I was surfing when those numbers came unnerving,<br/>
All I wanted was my favourite pages on my screen once more.<br/>
Just to see my favourite web page showing on my screen once more.<br/>
<em>Yet still the page read, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Deep upon the blank page peering, long I sat there wondering, fearing,<br/>
Doubting, thinking thoughts no geek had ever had to think before.<br/>
But the white page was unbroken, and the I-net gave no token,<br/>
Never had my system spoken of this surfing fault before.<br/>
“This” I exclaimed “can’t be happening for it’s never happened here before!”<br/>
<em>Yet on the page showed, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>To tech support I was left turning, all my soul within me burning,<br/>
Soon I heard a voice recording telling me to hold some more.<br/>
“Surely” thought I “this is but madness” growing was my techno sadness,<br/>
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this error I’ll explore.<br/>
Let my rage be still a moment and this error I’ll explore.<br/>
<em>What has made the page display the horrid number, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Open here I flung the case side, peering the electronics inside,<br/>
Focusing upon the Ethernet connection on the board.<br/>
Not an indication made it, not one error in baud or in bit,<br/>
Flashing from the data carried through it to my systems core.<br/>
Showing that it had a link to pass the data to my systems core.<br/>
<em>Yet still the page said, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the phone the music playing had every nerve within me praying,<br/>
Someone there would soon be saying “Hello this is tech support”.<br/>
But to my dismal outlook’s chagrin, the same old song had started again,<br/>
Causing me to swear and scream even louder than I had before.<br/>
Swearing loudly to the phone more fervently than I had before.<br/>
<em>Quoth the Server, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Much I marvelled this ungainly system which displayed so plainly,<br/>
A barren page which made me wish it would display just something more.<br/>
And I couldn’t help but seeing the data packets which were fleeting,<br/>
Flowing from the internet to wind up at my browsers door.<br/>
Packets flowing from the net which showed up blank and nothing more.<br/>
<em>What was this error, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>But the browser sitting lonely, on a blank page said this only,<br/>
These three numbers, as if its process in that number it did outpour.<br/>
Nothing further would it display, to my utter growing dismay,<br/>
Till I scarcely could remember it displaying something more.<br/>
Would it ever show me something other than this anymore?<br/>
<em>Quoth the Server, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Sitting at the website broken, not a graphic was there open,<br/>
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it displays is its only stock and store“.<br/>
Forgotten by some dense webmaster another mangled web disaster,<br/>
Refresh fast and ever faster, give me my page I adjure.<br/>
Stern despair returned, instead of the page I did adjure.<br/>
<em>This sad page read, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>But this sad site so beguiling, lead my sad soul into smiling,<br/>
Straight I wheeled my chair much closer to the desk than it had been before.<br/>
Then upon the keyboard typing, clear my brow from sweat by wiping,<br/>
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this number did implore.<br/>
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous number did implore.<br/>
<em>By displaying the digits, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>This I sat engaged in guessing, with no webpage yet expressing,<br/>
To the browser still bereft of anything I look for.<br/>
This and more I sat divining while my hard drives still were whining,<br/>
On the flat screen, still was shining the pale white page there had been before.<br/>
On the screen, there still was shining the same blank page I’d seen before.<br/>
<em>Screaming at me, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Then, I thought, the page did flicker making my contempt grow quicker,<br/>
Looking at the refresh button, begging it would be the cure.<br/>
“Wretch,” I cried, my patience left me, witness to the page I did see,<br/>
Respite- Respite and nepenthe, from my memories of the web I do adore.<br/>
Let me quaff this kind nepenthe and forget these pages I adore.<br/>
<em>Quoth the Server, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Webmaster!” said I, “thing of evil!- admin still if man or devil!<br/>
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed you here upon my browsers door.<br/>
Desolate it sits undaunted, on this blank screen, bleak, unwanted<br/>
By its pallid light I’m haunted, show my page I do implore.<br/>
Will my page resolve again, tell me this I do implore.<br/>
<em>Quoth the Server, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Webmaster!” said I, “thing of evil!- admin still if man or devil!<br/>
By the fibre that transports us to the net we all adore.<br/>
Tell this soul with sorrow heavy, must I pay another levy?<br/>
Just to see my favourite bevy which I’ve seen so much before.<br/>
To see the rare and radiant bevy of the likes I’ve seen before.<br/>
<em>Quoth the Server, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Be that number our sign of parting, Web or net!” I shrieked, upstarting-<br/>
“Get thee back into the network and back into my systems core”.<br/>
Leave no blank page as a token, of this number you have spoken,<br/>
Leave my surfing ways unbroken, quit this error evermore.<br/>
Take this lacuna from my sight, and take this error evermore.<br/>
<em>Quoth the Server, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>And the webpage, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,<br/>
On a bleak and empty site, devoid of content evermore.<br/>
And the page has all the seeming of a desert that is dreaming,<br/>
And the glow from the flat panel throws its white light to the floor,<br/>
And my soul from out that white light flickers fast upon the floor.<br/>
<em>With a page whose only graphic is the number, </em><b>404</b></blockquote>
